## 🚀 How It Works

[cite_start]Elevate's Unique Selling Proposition (USP) is its ability to generate a personalized roadmap from a single document—the user's resume[cite: 32].

The process is simple:
1.  [cite_start]**Step 1: Upload Your Resume**[cite: 34].
2.  [cite_start]**Step 2: AI Analysis Engine** processes the document[cite: 36].
3.  [cite_start]**Step 3: Receive Your Personalized Roadmap**, which bridges the gap between your current skills and in-demand industry roles[cite: 38].

[cite_start]The platform creates a 360-degree profile by analyzing both technical and soft skills to define what makes a candidate completely hirable[cite: 22, 25, 27, 28].

## 🏗️ System Architecture

[cite_start]Elevate's architecture is structured into four distinct layers to ensure a robust and scalable system[cite: 154].

## 🔄 User Workflow

The user journey from start to finish is designed to be seamless and intuitive.

1.  [cite_start]**Start & Authentication:** A new user accesses Elevate and creates a profile, while a returning user logs in[cite: 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 100]. [cite_start]Authentication is handled by Clerk[cite: 99, 110].
2.  [cite_start]**Interaction:** After successful authentication, the user can access their dashboard[cite: 101]. [cite_start]They can interact with the AI Chatbot by sending queries and receiving generated responses on the frontend[cite: 103, 102, 104, 105, 108].
3.  [cite_start]**Skill Assessment:** The user navigates to the skill assessment page and uploads their resume (PDF/DOCX)[cite: 114, 116, 117].
4.  [cite_start]**Backend Processing:** The backend server extracts text from the resume[cite: 113, 115]. [cite_start]An AI Model API processes this text to generate structured JSON data[cite: 119, 120].
5.  [cite_start]**Personalized Guidance:** The structured data is used to fetch and display the assessment results on the Career Paths page, including recommended job roles and skills to improve[cite: 121, 122, 124].
6.  [cite_start]**End:** The user receives personalized guidance to help them on their career journey[cite: 129]. [cite_start]All relevant data, like user profiles and chat history, is stored in a database[cite: 128].
